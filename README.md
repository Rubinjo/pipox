Pipox is a messaging app in which the user can stay completely anonymous. This is done by only assigning a random user id on every restart of the app. Pipox was created with [React-Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) and supporting technologies like [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo), [React Navigation V5](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation), [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Release

Pipox is not intended to be released and was mainly developed as learning project for learning to integrate [React-Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) with the different supporting technologies named earlier.
